> Import/Export Labels between two github projects
> You have to have an account who have enough rights for that kind of process

## Why this package

One day with a teammate, we have many repositories and one of them only have been set with 
labels we use everyday. So we have to copy all of them in each repository. So we go on github
labels interface and suprise ! You have to create your label one by one...

This project was born. Some other package allow you to do such things.

I just want to group them here and maybe add more.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install github-label-manager --g
```

In your env variable you have to put this keys :

GITHUB_USER = "userWhoWillDoProcess"

GITHUB_TOKEN = "yourToken"


## Usage

```sh
$ #Copy labels from origin to destination
$ glm copy <origin-repo-name> <destination-repo-name>
$ #Import labels from json file to repository
$ glm import <repo-name> <path-to-json-file>
$ #Export labels from repository to json file  
$ glm export <repo-name> <path-to-json-file>
$ #Clear all labels from origin
$ glm clear <origin-repo-name>
$ glm --help
```

## Todo

- Refactor code
  + Too many copy/paste have to be factorised in services.
  + Other ideas ?
- Better error handling
  + Decrypt github error and display message accordingly
- Improve credential process
  + Keep existing
  + Add params in cmd line
  + Is it possible to configure it via a config command?
  + 3 levels
    * 1) Check command params
    * 2) Check global config
    * 3) Check env variables
    * 4) Sorry dude I can't do anything for you...
- Can import only label and randomly create a color for it
- Make some other cool thing :D
